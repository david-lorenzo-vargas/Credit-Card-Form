## React Hook Form

## Atomic approach

Atomic approach has been used for structuring and ordering the componets separated in 'atoms', 'molecules' and 'organisms'.

## Testing

Jest and React Testing Library have been used for testing. I have added testing to some components but, as further implementation, it would be necessary to add more unit and integration testing for other functionalities and components.

For running tests: `npm run test`
